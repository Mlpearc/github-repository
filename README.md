## GitHub Repository

A MediaWiki extension to link the Git SHA on Special:Version to your GitHub repository

###Installation

Clone into your extensions directory just like any other extension, then add to your LocalSettings.php just like any other extension.

###Purpose

To allow extension authors to easily link back to their GitHub repository for an extension. This also acts as a proof-of-concept to extension authors can see how to do something similar in the own extension.

### Licence

There's nothing really worth licencing in this extension, it's so small. Therefore, what bits aren't covered by MediaWiki's licencing, are released into the Public Domain.
